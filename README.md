# iOS Background Color Changer

## Overview
The iOS Background Color Changer is a simple application developed in Swift, showcasing how to dynamically change the background color of a UIView. Aimed at beginners in iOS development, this project covers fundamental concepts of UIKit and Swift programming, including event handling and UI updates.

## Features
- A straightforward UI with color selection options.
- Immediate background color update upon selection.
- Demonstrates use of UIViews, UIButton actions, and UIColor.

## Getting Started
To run this project, you'll need Xcode installed on your macOS system.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `.xcodeproj` file in Xcode.
3. Choose a target simulator or device.
4. Build and run the application with Xcode.

## How It Works
The application uses UIButton actions to trigger background color changes in a UIView. Each button is associated with a specific UIColor, and tapping a button updates the UIView's backgroundColor property accordingly.
