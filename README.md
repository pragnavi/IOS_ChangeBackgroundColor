App Idea:

I would like to improve Google Maps by creating an app called "SafeRoute." The primary goal of SafeRoute is to provide pedestrians with not only the fastest route but also the safest route to their destination. Key features would include:

Safety Ratings: The app would integrate data on crime rates, traffic accidents, and road conditions to provide safety ratings for different routes.
Pedestrian-Friendly Routes: SafeRoute will prioritize routes with well-lit streets, sidewalks, and pedestrian crosswalks, ensuring a safer journey.
Real-time Alerts: Users will receive real-time alerts and notifications about potential safety concerns or hazards along their chosen route.
Crowdsourced Data: Users can contribute safety information and incidents they encounter, enhancing the app's accuracy.
Customizable Preferences: Users can set their safety preferences, such as avoiding poorly lit areas, high-crime neighborhoods, or heavy traffic streets.
The app aims to make urban and suburban navigation safer and more accessible for pedestrians, offering peace of mind while traveling on foot.

This idea builds upon the existing Google Maps platform by adding safety-specific features to benefit pedestrians.
