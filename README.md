# iOS Background Color Changer

## Overview
The iOS Background Color Changer is a simple application developed in Swift, showcasing how to dynamically change the background color of a UIView. Aimed at beginners in iOS development, this project covers fundamental concepts of UIKit and Swift programming, including event handling and UI updates.

## Features
- A straightforward UI with color selection options.
- Immediate background color update upon selection.
- Demonstrates use of UIViews, UIButton actions, and UIColor.

## Getting Started
To run this project, you'll need Xcode installed on your macOS system.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `.xcodeproj` file in Xcode.
3. Choose a target simulator or device.
4. Build and run the application with Xcode.

## How It Works
The application uses UIButton actions to trigger background color changes in a UIView. Each button is associated with a specific UIColor, and tapping a button updates the UIView's backgroundColor property accordingly.

[//]: #  # Prework - *CodePath*

[//]: # Submitted by: **Pragnavi Rauvluri Sai Durga**

[//]: # **CodePath** is an app that changes the background color of the app on a button click

[//]: # Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

[//]: # ## Required Features

[//]: # The following **required** functionality is completed:

[//]: # - [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
[//]: # - [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

[//]: # ## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

[//]: # Favorite Apps and Features:

[//]: # Google Maps:

[//]: # Offline Navigation: Users can download maps for specific regions to navigate without an internet connection.
[//]: # Live Public Transport Information: Real-time updates on bus and train schedules, including delays and platform information.
[//]: # Voice Search: Users can search for locations and get directions using voice commands.
[//]: # Street View: Access 360-degree street-level imagery for selected locations, aiding in visualizing destinations.
[//]: # Location Sharing: Share real-time location with friends and family for a specified duration, enhancing safety and coordination.

[//]: # WhatsApp:

[//]: # Status Updates: Users can post text, photos, or videos as their status, visible to their contacts for 24 hours.
[//]: # Group Video Calls: Conduct video calls with multiple participants, enabling group communication.
[//]: # Document Sharing: Send and receive various document formats, including PDFs, Word documents, and spreadsheets.
[//]: # Two-Step Verification: Add an extra layer of security to the account by enabling two-step verification.
[//]: # Customized Chats: Users can customize individual or group chat backgrounds, notification tones, and chat wallpapers.

[//]: # Spotify:

[//]: # Personalized Playlists: Curated playlists generated based on user listening habits and preferences, such as "Discover Weekly" and "Release Radar."
[//]: # Collaborative Playlists: Create playlists with friends, allowing them to add and edit songs collaboratively.
[//]: # Podcast Integration: Access a vast library of podcasts on various topics, including exclusive shows.
[//]: # Downloadable Playlists: Download playlists, albums, and podcasts for offline listening on the go.
[//]: # Lyrics Display: View synchronized lyrics while listening to songs, making it easy to sing along.

[//]: # App Idea:

[//]: # I would like to improve Google Maps by creating an app called "SafeRoute." The primary goal of SafeRoute is to provide pedestrians with not only the fastest route but also the [//]: # safest route to their destination. Key features would include:

[//]: # Safety Ratings: The app would integrate data on crime rates, traffic accidents, and road conditions to provide safety ratings for different routes.
[//]: # Pedestrian-Friendly Routes: SafeRoute will prioritize routes with well-lit streets, sidewalks, and pedestrian crosswalks, ensuring a safer journey.
[//]: # Real-time Alerts: Users will receive real-time alerts and notifications about potential safety concerns or hazards along their chosen route.
[//]: # Crowdsourced Data: Users can contribute safety information and incidents they encounter, enhancing the app's accuracy.
[//]: # Customizable Preferences: Users can set their safety preferences, such as avoiding poorly lit areas, high-crime neighborhoods, or heavy traffic streets.
[//]: # The app aims to make urban and suburban navigation safer and more accessible for pedestrians, offering peace of mind while traveling on foot.

[//]: # This idea builds upon the existing Google Maps platform by adding safety-specific features to benefit pedestrians.

[//]: # ## Notes

[//]: # Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

[//]: # I'm new to Xcode and Swift, so one of the initial challenges I encountered was getting familiarized with the Xcode interface and understanding the basics of Swift programming. At [//]: # first, it was a bit overwhelming to navigate the various features and tools within Xcode. However, with some time and practice, I gradually became more comfortable with the [//]: # [//]: # environment and began to understand the fundamentals of Swift. Once I was familiar with these aspects, I found it much easier to work on the app and make progress in building its [//]: # features.
